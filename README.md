# Customize CRA without ejecting using react-app-rewired

This is the companion code for an [egghead](https://egghead.io) lesson
showing how to set up react-app-rewired in a Create React App project,
and then use it to add SCSS support.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
